1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ans: .gitignore is a file that has a list of all files in a project that shouldn't be tracked by git. 
In a java project, the gitignore file should include the package files(
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar), the compiled class files(*.class), the log files(*.log), the BlueJ files(*.ctxt), the mobile tools for java(.mtj.tmp/), and the virtual machine crash logs(hs_err_pid*).

2. What does fast-forward in git mean?
Ans: Fast-forward in git means the main branch's tip is moved towards the end of the merged branch. 
This keeps all commits created in the feature branch sequential while integrating it neatly back into the main branch.

3. Why should you have different branches?
Ans: There should be different branches to develop different features independently. There should always be one main branch and one development branch.
The main branch should not break due to merge conflicts, and should always have the working copy of code. 
The development branch can be used to merge and test multiple feature branches.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ans: In a project, I usually have only one remote git repository to track the development of all team members in the project.
